Qub
=============
An Implementation of Multiplayer Quiz Bowl.

- Uses HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end stuff.
- Uses PHP for the back-end.
- Transactions are using PHP Websockets.

## Credits
- Special thanks to Sharad Vikram and his site QuizbowlDB.com.
- That's where I get all of the questions from right now.
- This uses the PHP-Websocket Library as conceived by Lemmingzshadow.

## File Notes
- Client files are located in /client.
- CSS/JS files are now located in /client/client for consistency.

- Server files are located in /server.
- Run server.php to start the server-side code.

## Demo

- See skalon.com/qub for a working implementation of this.
