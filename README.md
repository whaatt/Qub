Qub
=============
An Implementation of Multiplayer Quiz Bowl

- Uses HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end stuff.
- Uses PHP for the back-end.
- Transactions are using PHP Websockets.

### Credits
- Special thanks to Sharad Vikram and his site QuizbowlDB.com.
- That's where I get all of the questions from right now.
- This uses the PHP-Websocket Library as conceived by Lemmingzshadow.

### File Notes
- Client files are located in /client.
- CSS/JS files are now located in /client/assets.
- Server files are located in /server.

### Python Daemon
- I added this as a safeguard against server shutdowns.
- Daemon.py will restart the server automatically.
- Run daemon.py to start the server-side code.

### Demo
- See skalon.com/qub for a working implementation of this.
- I would certainly appreciate notification of clones.
